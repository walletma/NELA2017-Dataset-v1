This data set contains news articles from 92 news sources between April 2017 and October 2017. 

The folder structure is as follows: month -> day -> source -> articles

Each article file is a JSON file titled in the following format: source-date-first100wordsoftitle.txt

Each JSON file is a dictonary with the following feilds:
	- content - the text from the body of the article
	- title - the text from the title of the article
	- source - the source of the article
	- author - the journalist who wrote the article, if the
	- information is available in the web page meta data

	to the web page

	page depending on how the source was scraped)
	- html - the full HTML of the article page stored as unicode
	
In the folder "supplementary data", there are feature vectors (formated as a csv) for each news article with the filename as the vector id. Each vector has 130 features on the body text and title text separately. Details about these features can be found in our ICWSM 2018 paper.
